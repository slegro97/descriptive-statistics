# descriptive-statistics
This Python project is a comprehensive display of a range of descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques. The program begins by loading datasets via Pandas, and provides comprehensive statistical insights, including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, and coefficient of variation. It also calculates covariance and correlation between variables to assess relationships within the data.

To explore data distribution, the project implements normal distribution analysis and conducts the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. For enhanced data interpretation, visualizations like heatmaps and density curves are generated using Seaborn, offering clear insights into patterns and trends.

Skills demonstrated in this project include:

- Data loading and preprocessing with Pandas
- Statistical analysis with SciPy for measures like variance, covariance, and normality testing
- Data visualization using Seaborn to create heatmaps, density plots, and correlation matrices
- Problem-solving by exploring relationships and distribution patterns in complex datasets

This tool provides robust insights into datasets, making it an ideal solution for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preliminary statistical modeling.
